# Phase differences between QPO fundamental and harmonic signals
The dataset computed and analysed in De Ruiter et al. (in prep.). It contains fit parameters of Type-B and Type-C QPO power spectra, measured from archival RXTE observations. Additionally, it contains the measured phase difference between the fundamental and harmonic peak. 

The two files concern the Type-B and Type-C QPO analysis.
